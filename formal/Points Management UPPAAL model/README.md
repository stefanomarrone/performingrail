## Points Management UPPAAL model
Points Management is the function of the trackside devoted to the management of points locking and unlocking. We have modelled the Points Management funtion via a network of different UPPAAL timed automata. We have one main automata which communicates with the other timed automata. The CreateRoute automata creates the route, the SetandLock automata models the situation where we detect the final position of the point, SweepableandOverride timed automaton describes the case of a sweeping train that frees some points.
