# SAN model
The objective of the SAN model is to enable the evaluation of performance and performability properties at the system level. These properties are evaluated with respect to the movement of a train fleet on a track under the control of a trackside.
This folder contains also a variant of the model (the one with the postfix _LossOfComm) that considers a potential temporary loss of communication of a single train.

## Prerequisites
The model has been developed in Möbius 2.5.10, available at http://www.mobius.illinois.edu

## Usage
The .tar.gz archive has to be downloaded and moved in the Projects Directory of Möbius. Then, open Möbius and you should see the file under the Archive folder. With the right click on it, unarchive the project. A simulator is available in the simulator folder, with parameters given in the study.
