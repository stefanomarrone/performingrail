# Performingrail's Moving Block Modelling Baseline

This folder contains modelling baseline of future ETCS-L3 moving block signalling systems according to the objective of the WP2 - Modelling and Analysis of Moving Block Specifications of the PERformance-based Formal modelling and Optimal tRaffic Management for movINGblock
RAILway signalling (Performingrail) project. 

## The PerformingRail project:
Performingrail aims to deliver formal modelling and optimal traffic management, a moving block railway signalling using advanced train positioning approaches that mitigates potential hazards in the diverse market segments. It is a project funded by the Shift-to-Rail EU Programme.

The context and the explaining of the artefacts contained in this repository are reported in D2.2 (to apper on https://projects.shift2rail.org/s2r_ip2_n.aspx?p=S2R_PERFORMINGRAIL).

## Repository structure:
- **sysml**: SysML model of the ETCS-L3 MB signalling system.
- **formal**: containing formal models of ETCS-L3 aspects (using Timed Automata and Stochastic Activity Networks).
- **other**: other useful information related to the models (video howtos, requirement sheets, etc.)
