# Performingrail's Moving Block Modelling Baseline

This folder contains modelling baseline of future ETCS-L3 moving block signalling systems according to the objective of the WP2 - Modelling and Analysis of Moving Block Specifications of the PERformance-based Formal modelling and Optimal tRaffic Management for movINGblock
RAILway signalling (Performingrail) project. 

## The PerformingRail project
Performingrail aims to deliver formal modelling and optimal traffic management, a moving block railway signalling using advanced train positioning approaches that mitigates potential hazards in the diverse market segments. It is a project funded by the Shift-to-Rail EU Programme.
