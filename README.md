# PerformingRail's Moving Block Modelling Baseline

This folder contains modelling baseline of future ETCS-L3 moving block signalling systems according to the objectives of the WP2 - Modelling and Analysis of Moving Block Specifications of the PERformance-based Formal modelling and Optimal tRaffic Management for movINGblock
RAILway signalling (PerformingRail) project. 

## The PerformingRail project:
PerformingRail aims to deliver formal modelling and optimal traffic management, a moving block railway signalling using advanced train positioning approaches. It is a project funded by the Shift-to-Rail EU Programme.

The description of the context, the development process and the details of the artefacts contained in this repository is reported in D2.2 (to appear on https://projects.shift2rail.org/s2r_ip2_n.aspx?p=S2R_PERFORMINGRAIL).

## Repository structure:
- **sysml**: SysML model of the ETCS-L3 MB signalling system.
- **formal**: ormal models of ETCS-L3 aspects (using Timed Automata and Stochastic Activity Networks).
- **other**: other useful information related to the models (video howtos, requirement sheets, etc.)

## Scientific and technical papers
Some scientific and technical papers have been published, based on the work and the models contained in this repository.
